This app is created for study purpose.<br/>
I made this app based on the cousre I learn in "udemy.com".<br/>
Course name: "The Complete Android N Developer Course".<br/>
Lecturer: Rob Percival.<br/>

This app is used to read news of technology.
I slightly change the original version of the course. Since storing html page takes too much time, I store url page in database instead.
